MDS based Converged Model

The SM/SG is implemented in Matlab. See ReadMe in MDS_Sparse/ for detailed instruction.

Stylized networks illustrate the transitivity and aggregation effects of social network convergence. Run SM/SG on stylized networks by the following line.

	mds_sparse('transitivity1.txt',2,pwd)
		where 'transitivity1.txt' is the input file
			2 is the dimensionality
			pwd is the output path

The output file will be named by 'loc_transitivity1.txt'. To see the visualization of the converged layout. Run nodesPlot.py in Plots/ by:
	python nodesPlot.py loc_transitivity1.txt
